# Tulip Supply and Demand API Integration

There's a Tulip Supply and Demand API available at `https://4hmd1l6e32.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api`.

For example, call the api using this cURL:
```
$ curl https://4hmd1l6e32.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api
```

It should return data in a format similar to that in `tulip/example_tulip_api_response.json`.
